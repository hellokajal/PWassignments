    "\n",
    "Qualitative data, also known as categorical data, describes characteristics or qualities that cannot be measured numerically. It is often divided into two subtypes: nominal and ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data: This type consists of categories without any inherent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of fruit (e.g., apple, banana, orange)\n",
    "Gender (e.g., male, female, non-binary)\n",
    "Marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: This type consists of categories with a clear order or ranking but without consistent intervals between the ranks.\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)\n",
    "Educational levels (e.g., high school, bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured and expressed mathematically. It can be further categorized into interval and ratio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Data: This type consists of numerical values with meaningful differences between them, but no true zero point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0 degrees does not mean 'no temperature')\n",
    "IQ scores (the difference between scores is meaningful, but there’s no absolute zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data: This type has all the properties of interval data, but also includes a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios. Examples include:\n",

    "1. Mean\n",
    "The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Median\n",
    "The median is the middle value when a dataset is ordered from least to greatest. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: The median is most appropriate for skewed distributions or when there are outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. For example, in income data where a few individuals earn significantly more than the rest, the median provides a better representation of typical income.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all.\n",

    "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset that highlights its central tendency, variability, and potential outliers. It provides a visual summary of key statistical measures in a compact form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of a Box Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Box: The main part of the box plot is a rectangle (the box) that represents the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and contains the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1: The first quartile (25th percentile), which is the median of the lower half of the dataset.\n",
    "Q3: The third quartile (75th percentile), which is the median of the upper half of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median Line: A line within the box indicates the median (Q2) of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whiskers: Lines (whiskers) extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles. This helps indicate the range of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers and are typically represented as individual dots or symbols. Outliers are values that lie more than 1.5 times the IQR above Q3 or below Q1.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a Box Plot Tells You:\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Tendency: The median line within the box indicates the center of the data, allowing you to quickly see where most data points lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread: The width of the box (IQR) shows the variability of the middle 50% of the data. A wider box indicates more variability, while a narrower box suggests less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness: The position of the median line within the box can indicate skewness. If the median is closer to Q1, the data may be positively skewed; if it’s closer to Q3, it may be negatively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: Outliers can be easily identified, helping to assess the presence of extreme values in the dataset that may affect statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparisons: Box plots can be used to compare distributions across different groups by placing multiple box plots side by side. This allows for visual comparison of central tendencies, spreads, and outliers."

    "Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a distribution. It indicates how much and in which direction a distribution deviates from a symmetrical shape (like a normal distribution). Understanding skewness is crucial for interpreting data accurately, as it can affect statistical analyses and conclusions drawn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skewness (Right Skewed):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a positively skewed distribution, the tail on the right side (higher values) is longer or fatter than the left side.\n",
    "The mean is typically greater than the median, and the median is greater than the mode (Mean > Median > Mode).\n",
    "Example: Income distributions often show positive skewness, as a small number of individuals may earn significantly higher incomes than the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Skewness (Left Skewed):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left side (lower values) is longer or fatter than the right side.\n",
    "The mean is typically less than the median, and the median is greater than the mode (Mean < Median < Mode).\n",
    "Example: Test scores in a very easy exam may show negative skewness, where most students score high, but a few score much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution is said to have zero skewness when it is perfectly symmetrical.\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode are all equal, which is characteristic of a normal distribution.\n",
    "Example: A standard normal distribution (bell curve) has zero skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects of Skewness on Data Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean vs. Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "In skewed distributions, the mean can be heavily influenced by extreme values (outliers), leading to a misleading representation of the central tendency. The median, being less sensitive to outliers, provides a better measure of central tendency in skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) assume that the data are normally distributed. If the data are skewed, these tests may yield unreliable results. In such cases, transformations (like log or square root transformations) or non-parametric tests may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can impact how data is presented and interpreted in graphs. For instance, box plots can show skewness visually, helping identify potential outliers and the need for adjustments in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Making:\n",
    "\n",
    "In business or research contexts, skewness can inform decision-making. For example, if a product’s sales data is positively skewed, it may suggest that a few high-performing products drive overall sales, prompting a focus on those items."

    "\n",
    "The mean determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "The standard deviation determines the width of the distribution: a smaller standard deviation results in a steeper curve, while a larger standard deviation results in a flatter curve.\n",

    "The empirical rule describes how data are distributed in a normal distribution concerning the mean and standard deviation:\n",

    "68% Rule: Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (±1σ) of the mean. This means that if you take the mean and add or subtract one standard deviation, you will capture about 68% of the data points.\n",

    "95% Rule: Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (±2σ) of the mean. This means that if you take the mean and add or subtract two standard deviations, you will capture about 95% of the data points.\n",

    "99.7% Rule: Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (±3σ) of the mean. This means that if you take the mean and add or subtract three standard deviations, you will capture about 99.7% of the data points.\n",
